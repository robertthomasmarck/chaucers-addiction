<ul>
<li>Got into the gym last night.
&ndash; A bunch (9?) sled pulls backwards and forwards. Working on correcting my knee issues. 135 lbs.
&ndash; Leg/knee lifts. Good for the Iliopsoas. Gonna keep doing these.
&ndash; Deadhangs: Made a huge difference in my should comfort. Gotta keep doing them.
&ndash; API Tests for the Console endpoints started.
&ndash; Docker Tutorial started.</li>
</ul>
<p>To Do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image support on my site is not working. Gotta update.</li>
<li>Halio Cycle Tester needs to be written as a web application. The local app is crap.</li>
<li>Move the Cycle Tester to the QA Machine instead of my local. It gets in the way of things.
&ndash; Pycharm added. Need to pull down the repository.</li>
<li>Finish API Tests for the Console</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Docker Image for the website that matches what AWS uses. Might solve the troubleshooting problem.</li>
<li>Get certified in Docker.</li>
</ul>
<p>CISSP Study Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prerequisites:
&ndash; General understanding of IT and security.
&ndash; 5 Years of full-time paid work experience in two or more domains. I am taking it for the Associates Cert so this doesn&rsquo;t apply atm.
&ndash; Adhere to the formal code of ethics
&ndash; 6 Years of Formal Security Experience&hellip; Hmmm&hellip; Looks like I need a different cert to start with. I would need to get into a security role too fast. I might change directions becuase of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eight Domains covered by the exam:
&ndash; 1. Security and Risk Management
&ndash; 2. Asset Security
&ndash; 3. Security Architecture and Engineering
&ndash; 4. Communication and Network Security
&ndash; 5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
&ndash; 6. Security Assessment and Testing
&ndash; 7. Security Operations
&ndash; 8. Software Development Security</p>
</li>
