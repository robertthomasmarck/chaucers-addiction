<li>Back in the gym last night. Goal was to just get in the door. Once that was done everything else was a bonus. I focuses on rehab movements: sled pulls, reverse sled pulls, dead hangs, and leg lifts. Sore this morning, but feeling good. Sleep was wonky. Late night workouts are a no go. Diet-wise I am thinking I want to set up another Stickk scenario: lose 25 lbs before the end of the year or I lose $1000&hellip; It would work, but man I hate the idea.</li>
