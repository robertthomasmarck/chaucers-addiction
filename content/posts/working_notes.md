This is based loosely on the algorithm from XKCD: https://xkcd.com/936/, and a conversation with a friend. He told me his password and I still remember it, but I couldn't use it to get into his information. 



The goal is to make a pasword that is 1. Hard to crack, and 2. Easy to remember

1. Pick a comic/movie/song/painting/poem/book that is meaningful to you. The more meaningful the better, but don't pick your favorite. This makes it easier to remember.
	Examples:
		- Dune
		- Inception
		- The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe

2. Summarize the movie/book/etc with a short phrase.
	- Dune: Sand worms and space drugs
	- Inception: Dream theives and daddy issues
	- Talking birds and dead girlfriends

3. Remove the spaces and misspell a word or two. I prefer to capitalize each word in the phrase but it makes no difference.
	- SanndWormsandSppaceDrugs
	- DreamTheivesandDaaddyIssues
	- TalkingBirrdsandDeadGirlfriennds

4. Insert a meaningful number in the phrase. This makes it a but harder to remember but it helps with security.
	- SanndWorms31415andSppaceDrugs
	- DreamTheivesandDaaddy1999Issues
	- TalkingBirrdsandDeadGirlfriennds2022

5. Add a special character somewhere.
	- SanndWorms31415andSppaceDrugs!
	- DreamTheives&Daaddy1999Issues
	- Talking@BirrdsandDeadGirlfriennds2022

Ok, I'll admit the further down the steps you go the harder it is to remember. Steps 1 and 2 are enough for the average user. Adding step just 3, 4, or 5 will put your password in the impossible-to-crack category. All 5 are for the most paranoid with the best memories. I would only use this strategy for specific high-value targets, and the password would be used ONLY there.
