Done:
- Got into the gym last night.
-- A bunch (9?) sled pulls backwards and forwards. Working on correcting my knee issues. 135 lbs.
-- Leg/knee lifts. Good for the Iliopsoas. Gonna keep doing these. 
-- Deadhangs: Made a huge difference in my should comfort. Gotta keep doing them.
-- API Tests for the Console endpoints started.
-- Docker Tutorial started.

To Do:
- Image support on my site is not working. Gotta update.
- Halio Cycle Tester needs to be written as a web application. The local app is crap. 
- Move the Cycle Tester to the QA Machine instead of my local. It gets in the way of things.
-- Pycharm added. Need to pull down the repository.
- Finish API Tests for the Console

Ideas:
- Create a Docker Image for the website that matches what AWS uses. Might solve the troubleshooting problem.
- Get certified in Docker.

CISSP Study Notes:
- Prerequisites:
-- General understanding of IT and security. 
-- 5 Years of full-time paid work experience in two or more domains. I am taking it for the Associates Cert so this doesn't apply atm.
-- Adhere to the formal code of ethics
-- 6 Years of Formal Security Experience... Hmmm... Looks like I need a different cert to start with. I would need to get into a security role too fast. I might change directions becuase of this.

- Eight Domains covered by the exam:
-- 1. Security and Risk Management
-- 2. Asset Security
-- 3. Security Architecture and Engineering
-- 4. Communication and Network Security
-- 5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
-- 6. Security Assessment and Testing
-- 7. Security Operations
